Messagey layout for Compass Keyboard

This is an XML layout description file for the [Compass Keyboard](https://code.google.com/p/compass-keyboard/wiki/CompassKeyboard) input method for Android.

Compass Keyboard makes keys behave differently depending on how you touch them: a tap is different from a swipe upward is different from a swipe down and to the right, and so forth. It's a lot like the [MessagEase keyboard](http://www.exideas.com/ME/index.php), but free and open source.

However, Compass Keyboard has all the keys laid out differently. I find the MessagEase-style layouts more ergonomic. So I made Messagey, a layout for the English language that resembles the layout of the MessagEase keyboard.
